# Mouse-Event-using-OpenCV
These Mouse events include mouse clicks (like  left-button down, left-button up, left-button double-click etc) and movements over an attached OpenCV window. Capturing mouse click events with Python and OpenCV is easy. We just need to create a callback function and call this callback function using cv2.setMouseCallback('image', click_event_callback_function) method.
